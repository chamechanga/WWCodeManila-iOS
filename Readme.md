## Swift 
**A Modern Languge**
What's a modern language? It's one that's safe, fast, and expressive. As Apple was designing Swift, those three primary goals were at the core of every decision. As you learn programming concepts in Swift, you'll come to appreciate how each decision points to safety, speed, and clarity.

**Safe Language**
A number of features already mentioned make Swift a safe language by helping you write code that is less likely to crash your app. Computer programs are very literal, and so code written to handle one thing may not be capable of handling another. Type safety forces you to be explicit about the "type" of each object that you create, manipulate, and assign, and only lets you write code that the given object can handle. This prevents you from writing code that may crash if it is not designed to work with the "types" of objects you are referencing‚Äù

**Open Source**
In December 2015, Apple released the Swift language and supporting resources on GitHub as an open source project.
